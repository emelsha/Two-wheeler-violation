# Two-wheeler-violation-detection-in-fisat-campus-using-deep-learning
This project is a two-wheeler violation detection system that uses deep learning principles to detect and report various traffic violations, such as no helmet, triple carrying, and parking violations. The system is designed to control the rule in the campus accurately and cost effectively. It also has a message based module that sends an alert message to the college officials with the type of violation performed. The system aims to automate the 2 wheeler rules violation detection system inside the campus and make it easy for the officials to monitor the violation and take action in a fast and efficient way.
